They replace traditional telecom towers by providing last-mile connectivity for voice, text, and data services. AirNodes connect users to the network by communicating with EarthNodes and AetherNodes through the Internode API, ensuring user authentication and privacy."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why Should I Host an AirNode?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hosting an AirNode allows you to earn rewards while playing a vital role in expanding reliable internet connectivity to underserved areas. By hosting, you help bridge the digital divide, foster community development, and earn revenue based on network usage and quality of service."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Do I Need to Host an AirNode?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To host an AirNode, you need: a suitable location such as a rooftop or an open area to maximize coverage, reliable access to power and internet, and the ability to provide occasional maintenance support to the operator."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Are the Location Requirements for Hosting an AirNode?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"To host an AirNode, your location must meet these criteria: access to a consistent power supply, a strategic position to maximize coverage (e.g., rooftops or open areas), and minimal obstructions for optimal network performance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Are Rewards Calculated for AirNode Hosts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Rewards for hosting an AirNode depend on three factors: usage (volume of data, texts, and calls processed), quality of service (uptime, reliability, and user ratings), and a revenue share of 15% of the net revenue generated by the AirNode. Rewards can be claimed in fiat or cryptocurrency, depending on local regulations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Do I Start Hosting an AirNode?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Getting started involves the following steps: register your interest through the World Mobile AirNode sales platform, complete the verification process, create your Host Profile with details about you and your location, facilitate the installation of the AirNode with World Mobile's support, and ensure the AirNode operates efficiently by assisting with maintenance as needed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Are the Responsibilities of an AirNode Host?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As an AirNode Host, your responsibilities include providing a suitable location for the AirNode, ensuring power and internet availability, and supporting operators with occasional maintenance access. You do not need to manage network usage or operations directly."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are AirNodes Difficult to Maintain?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, AirNodes are designed for low maintenance. As a host, you only need to ensure the AirNode has a stable power supply, is securely installed, and is operational. Troubleshooting guides and support services are available for resolving common issues."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will Hosting an AirNode Affect My Internet Speed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hosting an AirNode has minimal impact on your internet speed if you have a reliable, high-speed connection. The AirNode's bandwidth usage is optimized to ensure smooth operation for both your internet and the AirNode."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Does Hosting an AirNode Benefit My Community?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"By hosting an AirNode, you provide affordable and reliable internet access, fostering digital inclusion and supporting economic growth in your community. This contributes to bridging the digital divide and ensures equitable access to digital resources."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Support Is Available for AirNode Hosts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"World Mobile provides comprehensive support for AirNode Hosts, including setup assistance, maintenance guidance, and a dedicated support team for troubleshooting issues. You'll also have access to The Club community forums for sharing insights and learning from other hosts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Tax Considerations Should I Be Aware Of?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"World Mobile does not offer tax advice. Hosts are encouraged to consult a local tax professional to understand their obligations based on earnings from AirNode hosting."}}]}0:{"P":null,"b":"8j-b6BZ-aCrLLCpEwOGEt","p":"","c":["","airnode-host",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["airnode-host",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/8082cd33653a30ed.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"\n      __variable_e832ff \n      __variable_8a8a4d \n      __variable_592db9 \n      __variable_a6d7e3 \n      __variable_ccb277 \n      __variable_5ac26d\n    ","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/014dfbd8f7502d55.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","$L4",null,{}]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":["airnode-host",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","airnode-host","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-gradient-to-b from-black via-[#150a2c] to-[#000000]","children":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"Host an AirNode | World Mobile Club"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"keywords","content":"Host AirNode, Decentralized Connectivity, World Mobile, Earn Rewards, WMTx"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"author","content":"World Mobile Club"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:site_name","content":"World Mobile Club"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:title","content":"Host an AirNode | World Mobile Club"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:description","content":"Host an AirNode with World Mobile to expand connectivity and earn rewards.
